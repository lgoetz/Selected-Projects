## ML/AI PROJECTS

### TWO-PLAYER BOARD GAME AI | Java framework

[github.com/lgoetz/two-player-ai](https://github.com/lgoetz/two-player-ai)

I wrote an object-oriented Java framework for two-player board games, that can be used for any board and player class. I implemented different player classes, distinguished by their type of tree search algorithm – minimax, alpha-beta pruning, Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) – and use heuristics to avoid full tree traversals for alpha-beta and MCTS players.

### LATENT LINEAR MODELS TUTORIAL | Python/Stan/Tensorflow

[bit.ly/latent-linear-models](bit.ly/latent-linear-models)

I wrote a Jupyter notebook tutorial for three types of latent linear models – PCA, probabilistic PCA and Factor Analysis. I show how to use Stan and Tensorflow to specify and fit models and compare the different projections obtained with PCA/pPCA/FA.


### SEIZURE DETECTION CHALLENGE | Hackathon, Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit 

[github.com/vincentadam87/gatsby-hackathon-seizure](github.com/vincentadam87/gatsby-hackathon-seizure)

I contributed to a hackathon predicting seizures from EEG time-series recordings of humans and dogs, using feature extraction and binary classification. We achieved the 9th place, published our results as Adam et al, 2015. Seizure Detection Challenge - The Fitzgerald team solution and were awarded a Honorable Mention at the 7th International Workshop on Seizure Prediction.


## DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS

### BIKE ROUTING APP | Data analysis & routing plug-in

[bit.ly/bike-accident-analysis](bit.ly/bike-accident-analysis)

[bit.ly/bike-rerouting-plugin](bit.ly/bike-rerouting-plugin)


I analysed publicLondon traffic and bike accident datasets and wrote a pilot for a routing plug-in for Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM)/OpenStreetMaps, that avoids accident hotspots.


### HUMAN FREEDOM INDEX | Explorative data analysis

[bit.ly/HFI-analysis](bit.ly/HFI-analysis)

I performed an explorative analysis of the Human Freedom Index (HFI) dataset. I performed different variable selections to identify key economic and legislative drivers and do case studies on the influence of economic and political developments (e.g. Arab Spring) on human freedom.

### SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING PROJECTS | Python course mini projects 

[ucl-cs-grad.github.io/scipython/projects](ucl-cs-grad.github.io/scipython/projects)

I designed mini projects for ’Scientific Programming in Python’ course, e.g. influenza outbreak analysis, spam filtering, and supervised teams of graduate students on their implementation.

## WRITING

### BIONEWS | Volunteer Writer
[bionews.org.uk/leagoetz](bionews.org.uk/leagoetz)

I write accessible articles about news, ethical & policy issues in reproduction, genetics & stem cell research.

### SHOGUN.ML | Writer & Mentor
[bit.ly/shogun-workshop](bit.ly/shogun-workshop)

[bit.ly/GSoC17-data-project](bit.ly/GSoC17-data-project)

As part of Shogun’s outreach, I write blog posts and document projects and workshops. I mentored several Google summer of Code projects and their documentation.
