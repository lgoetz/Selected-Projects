## ML/AI PROJECTS

### TWO-PLAYER BOARD GAME AI | Java framework

[github.com/lgoetz/two-player-ai](https://github.com/lgoetz/two-player-ai)

I wrote an object-oriented Java framework for two-player board games, that can be used for any board and player class. I implemented different player classes, distinguished by their type of tree search algorithm – minimax, alpha-beta pruning, Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) – and use heuristics to avoid full tree traversals for alpha-beta and MCTS players.

### MULTI-LAYER PERCEPTRON | Python/Tensorflow

[https://bit.ly/mlp-MNIST](https://gist.github.com/lgoetz/bbf2dc95d3dc1e86712096efed618847)

I wrote a multi-layer perceptron from scratch (using Python + Tensorflow), to demonstrate how to write architecture, batching data and training loop. Demonstrated the use on dummy data and MNIST.

### CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORK | Python/Tensorflow

[https://bit.ly/cancerCNN](https://gist.github.com/lgoetz/a1c815c27797ef2bde2eff91f4f98b81)

I built a convolutional neural network, to classify histological images of colorectal cancer. 


### LATENT LINEAR MODELS TUTORIAL | Python/Stan/Tensorflow

[bit.ly/latent-linear-models](https://gist.github.com/lgoetz/790a5e1a5b20ad9473aaacdf96fa90de)

I wrote a Jupyter notebook tutorial for three types of latent linear models – PCA, probabilistic PCA and Factor Analysis. I show how to use Stan and Tensorflow to specify and fit models and compare the different projections obtained with PCA/pPCA/FA.


### SEIZURE DETECTION CHALLENGE | Hackathon, Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit 

[github.com/vincentadam87/gatsby-hackathon-seizure](https://github.com/vincentadam87/gatsby-hackathon-seizure)

I contributed to a hackathon predicting seizures from EEG time-series recordings of humans and dogs, using feature extraction and binary classification. We achieved the 9th place, published our results as Adam et al, 2015. Seizure Detection Challenge - The Fitzgerald team solution and were awarded a Honorable Mention at the 7th International Workshop on Seizure Prediction.


## DATA PROJECTS

### GSOC DISEASE PREDICTION PROJECT | Mentoring Disease prediction

[GSoC20-data-project](https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/applications)

I mentor a Google Summer of Code student project for Shogun.ML, using Wikipedia pageview data to model flu incidence.

### GSOC HEALTH DATA PROJECT | Mentoring Data analysis & prediction

[bit.ly/GSoC17-data-project](https://gist.github.com/olinguyen/510f29a2dfeeca1aa30ac9bc2b474580)

I mentored a Google Summer of Code student project for Shogun.ML, using electronic health records from intensive care unit patients to predict clinical outcomes.


### BIKE ROUTING APP | Data analysis & routing plug-in

[bit.ly/bike-accident-analysis](https://gist.github.com/lgoetz/b2e98a9f45bbb05cda27c03b03e9b9f6)

[bit.ly/bike-rerouting-plugin](https://gist.github.com/lgoetz/274d5d96325bfb58f3bcda675898f2ee)


I analysed publicLondon traffic and bike accident datasets and wrote a pilot for a routing plug-in for Open Source Routing Machine (OSRM)/OpenStreetMaps, that avoids accident hotspots.


### HUMAN FREEDOM INDEX | Explorative data analysis

[bit.ly/HFI-analysis](https://gist.github.com/lgoetz/a2ea6acc120a24e932b78ee8e141a711)

I performed an explorative analysis of the Human Freedom Index (HFI) dataset. I performed different variable selections to identify key economic and legislative drivers and do case studies on the influence of economic and political developments (e.g. Arab Spring) on human freedom.

### SCIENTIFIC PROGRAMMING PROJECTS | Python course mini projects 

[ucl-cs-grad.github.io/scipython/projects](https://ucl-cs-grad.github.io/scipython/projects)

I designed mini projects for ’Scientific Programming in Python’ course, e.g. influenza outbreak analysis, spam filtering, and supervised teams of graduate students on their implementation.

## WRITING

### BIONEWS | Volunteer Writer
[bionews.org.uk/leagoetz](https://www.bionews.org.uk/leagoetz)

I write accessible articles about news, ethical & policy issues in reproduction, genetics & stem cell research.

### SHOGUN.ML | Writer & Mentor
[bit.ly/shogun-workshop](https://medium.com/@lea.goetz/the-shogun-workshop-c02b91bfd1be)

[bit.ly/GSoC17-data-project](https://gist.github.com/olinguyen/510f29a2dfeeca1aa30ac9bc2b474580)

As part of Shogun’s outreach, I write blog posts and document projects and workshops. I mentored several Google summer of Code projects and their documentation.
